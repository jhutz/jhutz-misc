=head1 NAME

chbs - generate an xkcd/936 style passphrase

=head1 SYNOPSIS

chbs [I<wordlist>...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program produces passphrases according to the method proposed in
L<http://www.xkcd.com/936/>.  It requires a list of exactly 4096 distinct
words, which may be provided in one or more files listed on the command
line.  If no command-line argument is given, a built-in list is used.

This works by reading a total of 8 bytes from /dev/random.  Each pair of
bytes is treated as a 16-bit quantity, the low-order 12 bits of which are
used as an index into the word list.  The program prints the resulting
four words, each on a separate line.  This results in a passphrase which
contains approximately 48 bits of entropy.

Since many systems use password "quality" checkers which insist that
passwords have properties like being in mixed case or using a combination
of letters, digits, and punctuation, it is recommended that users adopt a
consistent convention for combining the randomly-generated words into a
usable passphrase.  For example, one might capitalize the first letter of
each word, separate the words with dashes, and prefix the entire thing
with "123".  These modifications are not intended to increase the strength
of the passphrase (which lies entirely in the choice of words), but to
satisfy the artificial constraints of the quality checker.

=cut

@words = @ARGV ? <> : <DATA>;
open(F, "/dev/random");
read(F, $x, 8);
foreach (unpack("SSSS", $x)) {
  print $words[$_ & 0xfff];
}

exit 0;


=head1 BUILT-IN LIST

The built-in list contains exactly 4096 American English word, and
was constructed based on the intersection of two sources:

=over 4

=item 1

The English word list distributed as part of A.G. Reinhold's Diceware,
available from <http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html>.  The list
itself is <http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc>.

=item 2

Kevin Atkinson's SCOWL word list version 6, and in particular, the
file /usr/share/dict/american-english as found in version 6-3 of the
Debian 'wamerican' package.

=back

From those lists, I have eliminated:

=over 4

=item *

All entries not appearing in both lists

=item *

All entries containing non-ASCII characters

=item *

All entries containing non-letters

=item *

All entries less than four letters in length

=item *

The following 103 words, each of which can be formed by appending the
letter 'y' to some other word which remains in the list.  However, not all
such words were removed; a total of 38 remain.  The choice of which words
were removed was entirely subjective, based on how related the similar
words were.

  balky balmy beady beefy billy booty brainy brassy bulky bushy
  cagey cheeky chilly cocky cooky corny dirty dolly dreamy dressy
  dully dumpy dusky dusty filmy fishy foamy frilly fully fussy
  fuzzy gawky gluey goody goofy greedy gusty hairy heady hilly
  jazzy jerky jumpy junky kinky leafy leaky leery lefty loamy
  lofty lucky lumpy lusty mealy meaty messy milky misty moody
  mossy murky mushy needy panty perky picky pithy plushy puffy
  rainy reedy risky rocky roomy rusty salty sandy seedy showy
  silky skimpy smithy snowy soapy spooky stuffy sulky swampy sweaty
  tacky tangy testy thorny toady warty weedy windy wispy woody
  wordy wormy yeasty

=item *

The word "reed" (the list also contains the word "read").  However, other
homophones have not been removed.

=back

The resulting list was then sorted according to the "C" locale.

The built-in word list contains the word "horse", but does not contain
the words "correct", "battery", or "staple".

=head2 Checksums

Here are cryptographic checksums over the built-in list:

   * MD5:  fccf971b32719c7069c4e929cd07dd0a
   * SHA1: 2c2c9d4228dba1a1e3386eec35f39116fdd66f07

=head2 PGP Signature

What follows is a PGP signature of the built-in list, computed over

  contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
  feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
  Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.
  
  The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
  the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
  common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
  frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
  with Frequency Classification".
  
  The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

  The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
  Public Domain:
  
    Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
    From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>
  
    > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
    > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
    > be lacking any copyright notice.
  
    There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
    "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
    source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
    PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
    domain.
  
    Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100
  
    > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?
  
    That is the intention.
  
  The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.
  
  The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
  least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
  words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
  my inflection database.

  The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
  of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
  public domain.
  
  The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing
  in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
  package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
  dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
  top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
  list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
  myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
  other word lists is included.
  
  The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
  don't think can be copyrighted.
  
  The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
  "Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
  File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
  a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
  special/ directory.
  
  The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
  4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
  in the public domain.
  
  The 60 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and all words
  appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the
  12Dicts package.  A large number of names are also included: The 4,946
  female names and the 3,897 male names from the MWords package.
  
  The 70 level includes the 74,550 common dictionary words and the
  21,986 names list from the MWords package The common dictionary words,
  like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
  added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
  the 12Dics package which is the public domain
  
  The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
  ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
  Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,
  and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.
  
  The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
  is in the Public Domain:
  
    The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
    into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in

    use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
    must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
    the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
    favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
    community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
    may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
    mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
    that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,

  words from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement,
  and some additional words found in my part-of-speech database that
  were not found anywhere else.
